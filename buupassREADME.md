Front-End Task

Convert the image on the link here to a valid responsive HTML template, without using any front-end framework.



Javascript Code Test:

Using React Javascript Library, generate a seat-layout for a bus, from the JSON on this link : https://jsonblob.com/5409c272-4871-11e8-9fba-a7947f0fac70 .
    - The seat layout should be divided into 2-sections front-seat and other-seats.
    - Each section has seats arranged in an row with an aisle separating every 2-seats on a row.
    - There should be a clear distinction of the front-seats & other-seats sections and also a distinction for the booked-seats from the available seats.

This can be done with HTML-tables or any preferred format but strictly done on React or  without react but with a good explanation of why the alternate solution is better.
